# Hi there, I'm Veljko! ðŸ‘‹

A passionate final-year Electronic Engineering student from NiÅ¡, Serbia â€” curious about how technology shapes the world and eager to build solutions that matter.

I enjoy crafting clean, thoughtful code and exploring a wide range of tech â€” from web development to system design, and everything in between.  
Whether itâ€™s building a solid backend, experimenting with frontend frameworks, or diving into new tools, Iâ€™m always up for the challenge.
